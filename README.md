# EventSearch
A RESTful API to search for events in a given location.
This api can be used to store, retrieve, update and delete information about any event.

It is a nodejs API. I have used mongodb to store data for this api.

In the events directory the Event.js file acts as a model for the events and the EventController.js routes the request to differnt functions.

There is a db.js file to connect to the database.
